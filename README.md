# Ben Brunzel's Dotfiles
This is a collection of programm configurations that reside in my home directory, so called dotfiles. I use that exact setting on my linux workstation for my daily work.

## Installing
I use the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) tool to create symlinks from this repository into my home directory. For easy installation you just need git and bash installed, issue:
```
git clone https://github.com/asciijungle/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install
```

## Feedback
If you have questions or feedback to any of the configuration contained in this repository feel free to open up an issue or it me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/asciijungle)
